#Artificial intelligence based on statistical model is being applied in developing the system. An intelligent system could be approached in two of the following ways namely self-learning-based models and statistical-rule-models. The latter is experimented with vector similarity scores between the two vectors. This magnitude between the vectors is used to identify the relevant information from the vocabulary. The dataset for the work is being used from Wikipedia by web-scraping the information related to article on ‘University of Calgary’. However, the web-scrapped context is pre-processed and converted to tokens for easy implementation. The TF-IDF method is used to extract the relevant information from the vocabulary and convert them to vectors. The ‘cosine similarity’ method is then used to calculate the magnitude and direction of the vectors. The one’s with closer angle and a magnitude of closer to 0 would mean that the vectors are closely related to each other. Thus the corresponding corpus is appended at the end of the list and presented as the relevant information to the question. This is being made use in voice-assistants, chatbots and document similarity search engines for extracting relevant information from the document.
